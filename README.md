Hi! I am Victor Hui and welcome to my github page. This github had been inactive for a long time but my other one was getting to messy, so I decided to start fresh here.

My github is mainly used to store projects that I have worked on, and some cool school assignments that I have completed so that I can return to it :)

My interests are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Distributed Systems. 

Enjoy your stay!
